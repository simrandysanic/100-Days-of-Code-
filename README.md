# -100-Days-of-Code-
The official website: https://www.100daysofcode.com/


I've decided to code at least for 1 hour everyday for the next 100 days.
I'm making this a public committment. 
I'm taking this challenge because I want to work on my programming skills, and improve them. 

<h3>Two Main Rules</h3>
Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
