<p>I've decided to code at least for 1 hour everyday for the next 100 days.</p>
<p>I'm making this a public committment.</p>
<p>I'm taking this challenge because I want to work on my programming skills, and improve them.</p> 

<h3>Two Main Rules</h3>
<p>Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.</p>
<p>Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.</p>
